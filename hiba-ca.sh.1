.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hiba-ca.sh
implements a basic Certificate Authority managed by the command line that supports several operations:
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
Create a CA key pair.
.IP \n+[step]
Create, import or remove a user/host key pair.
.IP \n+[step]
Add or Remove permissions for a user to request HIBA grants.
.IP \n+[step]
Sign a user/host public key into a certificate, optionally attaching HIBA grants.
.PP
The Certificate Authority stores all the keys on disk, following a predefined structure.
This predefined structure allows to reference SSH identities as well as HIBA extensions directly by name.
It expects the HIBA extensions to be generated in the following folders:
.IP \[bu] 2
.IR "capath" "/policy/identities/" "identity_name"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/policy/grants/" "grant_name"
.PP
And keeps the SSH identities in the following folders:
.IP \[bu] 2
.IR "capath" "/users/" "username"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/users/" "username" ".pub"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/users/" "username" "-cert.pub"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/hosts/" "hostname"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/hosts/" "hostname" ".pub"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/hosts/" "hostname" "-cert.pub"
.PP
The policy permissions are managed via symlinks in the following folder:
.IP \[bu] 2
.IR "capath" "/policy/principals/" "username" "/" "grant_name1" " -> "
.IR "capath" "/policy/grants/" "grant_name1"
.IP \[bu]
.IR "capath" "/policy/principals/" "username" "/" "grant_name2" " -> "
.IR "capath" "/policy/grants/" "grant_name2"
.IP \[bu]

.SH OPTIONS
This program only accepts short options.
.TP
.B \-c
Create new identities (CA, user or host).
.TP
.B \-l
Show the content of the certificate authority (not showing any secrets).
.TP
.B \-i
Import new identities (user or host).
.TP
.B \-r
Remove existing identities (user or host). When used with -p, remove HIBA policy permission.
.TP
.B \-p
.RI "Add HIBA policy permission on a " "grant" " for a " "user" ". When used with -r, remove said permission.
.TP
.B \-s
Sign certificates (user or host).
.TP
.B \-d
.IR "capath" " of the CA (will be initialized on the first call if it doesn't exist yet). Default to ~/.hiba-ca."
.TP
.B \-u
.RI "Request creating/importing/removing/signing a " "user" " certificate. When used with -l, shows information about users."
.TP
.B \-h
.RI "Request creating/importing/removing/signing a " "host" " certificate. When used with -l, shows information about hosts."
.TP
.B \-I
.RI "The " "name" " of the identity to create/sign. This is also used as the main " "principal" " during the signing operation."
.TP
.B \-n
.RI "Extra " "principal" " to add to the certificate. This flag can be repeated for adding more than one " "principal" "."
.TP
.B \-V
.IR "validity" " to set to the certificate. Default to '+1h'. See " "ssh-keygen(1)" " for the expected syntax."
.TP
.B \-z
.IR "serial" " to set to the certificate. THis is useful when planning to work with " "KRL" " and/or " "GRL" ". Default '0'."
.TP
.B \-H
.RI "Name of the " "HIBA" " extensions to be attached to the certificate at signing time. This flag can be repeated for adding more than one " "HIBA" " extension. When used with -p this lists extensions to be added/removed."
.SH NOTES
.RI "When the " "hiba-ca.sh" " generates the users & hosts private keys, it is for convenience only. It is not required to leave the private keys in the " "capath" ".
