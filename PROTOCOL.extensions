# HIBA Extensions

## Type of extensions supported by HIBA

HIBA supports two kinds of extensions:

| Name       | Target            | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| identity   | Host certificate  | Defines the identity of host, used to match |
:            :                   : grants at connection time.                  :
| grant      | User certificate  | Defines which identity this certificate     |
:            :                   : gives access to.                            :

## Overall format

Each extension is a list of key/value pairs and is following the openssh
serialized format. The extension content also contains a header that describes
the type, the version and a minimum supported version that allows backward
incompatible changes. The last field is a count of the number of key/value
pairs.

```
	uint32  magic
	uint32  type
	uint32  vers
	uint32  min_vers
	uint32  npairs
```

Where magic is defined as:

```
#define HIBA_MAGIC		0x48494241
```

Where type is defined by the following:

```
#define HIBA_UNKNOWN_EXT	0
#define HIBA_IDENTITY_EXT	'i'
#define HIBA_GRANT_EXT		'g'
```

The current version starts at 1, and so does minimum supported version.

The rest of the data is a list of strings key1, value1, key2, value2, ...
There must be exactly one value per key.

The HIBA tools support the identity and grant extensions both in their raw
serialized form as well as in base64 encoding.

Warning: For attaching multiple grants to a single certificate one MUST use a
comma separated list of base64 encoded grants (raw serialized extension only
supports one grant per certificates).

## Extensions ID

The HIBA extensions are identified by the following IDs:

* `identity@hibassh.dev`: a host certificate can only have one
  identity extension attached.
* `grant@hibassh.dev`: a user certificate can have an arbitrary
  number of grant extensions attached. Access will be granted if any grant
  extension matches.

## Special extension keys

HIBA reserves five extension keys with a special meaning:

| Key       | Description                                                      |
| --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------|
| hostname  | The hostname constraint used in a HIBA grant is directly checked |
:           : against the hostname of the target host as returned by the       :
:           : gethostname() syscall, even if no host certificate is present on :
:           : the target host. This allows a low-level last resort way to      :
:           : contact a host that has a corrupted host certificate or identity :
:           : extension.                                                       :
| domain    | The domain constraint used in a HIBA grant is checked against the|
:           : corresponding HIBA identity, but this key is mandatory in both   :
:           : extensions. This allows preventing inadvertantly granting wide   :
:           : privileges when managing different domains using the same CA key :
| options   | The list of SSH options to be applied to this SSH connection, as |
:           : they would be listed in an authorized_users or authorized_keys   :
:           : file.                                                            :
| validity  | The duration in seconds from the supporting certificate issued   |
:           : date. This means that a certificate can have unlimited validity, :
:           : but some of the grants attached would be able to expire          :
:           : independently.                                                   :
| role      | The target requested role to grant access to. This can be the    |
:           : principal itself or any other role available on the target host. :
